Chose Probabilistic Roadmap for following reasons:
* Simple Configuration Space - The C-Space only has rectangular obstacles, making connectedness a cheap computation
* Algorithm is easier to write
* If no path can be found, the graph can be cheaply regenerated
* Relies on A* for pathfinding, with good heauristic of euclidean distance making it reliable
* K-Nearest Neigbours is fairly cheap especially with good implementation and only graph sizes
